## 📌 Notes
This project is still a **work in progress**.  
I have implemented responsive CSS to support smaller screen sizes, but the mobile experience is currently **not fully polished**.
**Next steps:**
- Refine media queries and layouts for better usability on phones
- Test across different devices and screen sizes
- Improve the touch experience and spacing for smaller viewports

✅ **Contributions, suggestions, or feedback are always welcome!**
